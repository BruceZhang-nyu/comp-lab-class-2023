# Week 1

## Getting set up
- Get GitHub student developer pack working
- Fork this github repository to your own repository by clicking fork and following the instructions

## Get some practice with the command line
- Brush up on command line. Do Command line, text-fu, and advanced-text fu (VIM part) on https://linuxjourney.com/
- Command line text editing - I suggest you learn to use the program VIM. The best tutorial is the built in one, which you can get by just typing vimvtutor on greene

## Git tutorial
Now that you know a bit about the command line, do a git tutorial so that you are ready to use it starting next week

Follow the first part of this git tutorial to learn the basic commands, up until the part about github, which we can discuss in class next time
https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp

## Extra - some programming practice:
If you've never programmed, learn a little python. A decent tutorial to follow might be https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp from beginning to Arrays; to get regular python on greene run the command module load python/intel/3.8.6
Alternatively you could do this shorter one which is written by chemistry people (part 1-8) https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/. For this, you can get a notebook started by https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu/ -> Interactive Apps -> Jupyter Notebook on greene
